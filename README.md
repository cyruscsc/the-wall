# the-wall

A forum project inspired by the Lennon Wall in Hong Kong.

Built with Flask and Bootstrap.

## Buttons

All buttons on the nav bar and title section are not available yet.


## /posts_generator

This directory is not the core part of the project. The program inside is built for generating random dummy posts displayed on the webpages. The folder also includes the data and images of the dummy posts created. But the webpages do not get data from this folder, they get the same data from a online JSON storage bin instead.
